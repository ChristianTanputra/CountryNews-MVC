# CountryNews-MVC
A trending news app by country, written using UIKit (Storyboard) for Academy Challenge.

App shows current news taken from newsapi.org's API. News are shown in a list and are clickable to show content, while also allowing the user to open the full website through Safari. 

Before trying to run the app, make sure you have a API key from newsapi.org by registering on their site. Fields that need to be edited (country and API key) are both available in Service > PullData.swift .
